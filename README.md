# sn1ppet

## Why?

It is annoying to search for specific code snippets again and again and we do not like it. Always the same Stack Overflow posts that you read? That is not a good workflow so that was the reason for creating sn1ppet. A clean snippet viewer with nice functionalities built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com/) :heart:. We are not trying to reinvent the wheel, we only needed a fast way to find snippets. 

## Functionalities

We prepared a [demo](http://sn1ppet.github.io/various/sn1ppet-demonstration.html) for showing you the functionalities of a snippet.

* Create snippets via Markdown [files](https://github.com/sn1ppet/sn1ppet.github.io/tree/master/_posts)
* Search on all pages by just typing the term
* Snippet [listing](http://sn1ppet.github.io/recent.html) by post date
* Category [listing](http://sn1ppet.github.io/categories.html)
* Embed [Can I use support widget](http://www.andismith.com/caniuse-widget/) easily
* [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) support
* [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) integrated
* Snippet code as highlighted code or inserted in [Ace editor](http://ace.c9.io)

## Categories

You can find Drupal, CSS, JavaScript and Git related snippets. For sure the amount of categories is growing but we will not add every proposed category.

## Not only for snippets

Even if you want to have all *your* snippets there just [fork](https://github.com/sn1ppet/sn1ppet.github.io/fork) this repository. People already mentioned that you can use this setup of website for other things like a styleguide or tiny wiki. Be creative :)
